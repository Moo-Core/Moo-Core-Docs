# ðŸ¤  Introduction
Welcome to the documentation pages for Moo Core. This is an always-in-development framework. The base set of resources from the character creation to moonshine and drugs will be offered for free. Premium resources will be released alongside the development of this core for use with this core. These premium resources will not be required by any means and the core can be used and expanded upon by you or your development team!

The goal of this core is to create a framework that is easy to edit, manipulate, and mold to your needs. There are not enough good resources out there for RedM. I intend to change that.


# Community
Currently, there are no servers where you can test this out live, however, the main playground and live testing grounds will be via Emerald Plains, an up-and-coming server created by the man who started Ranch Roleplay. I post dev previews, updates, and more in this discord.

# Getting Started
I will have more information here on how to get started soon. Until then, hold tight while I get ready for release!
