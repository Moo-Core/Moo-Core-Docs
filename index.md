# ðŸ‘‹ Introdcution
Welcome to the documenation pages for Moo Core. This is an always-in-development framework. The base set of resources from the character creation to moonshine and drugs will be offered for free. Premium resources will be released alongside the development of this core for use with this core. These premium resources will not be required by any means and the core can be used and expanded upon by you or your development team!

The goal of this core is to create a framework that is eay to edit, manipulate, and mold to your needs. There are not enough good resources out there for RedM. I intend to change that.
