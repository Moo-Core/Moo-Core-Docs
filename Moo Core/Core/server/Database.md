# ðŸ“ƒDatabases
<hr>
The db.lua file contains all of the database interactions done for player and character data (for the most part). The functions are held within the Core.DB table and are called strictly within the core file structures. No other resource should be calling these functions, but other resources are just fine to interact with the databases that are made by the core.
